# Render Blueprint / build config
# Ensures build uses root requirements.txt (includes anthropic>=0.39.0, sendgrid, etc.)
#
# If your service was created manually, set Build Command in Dashboard to:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install anthropic sendgrid && pip list | grep -i anthropic
# Or use: bash build.sh (build.sh also runs pip install anthropic sendgrid).
